## SEO Landing Pages

### URL Status Matrix

| URL | Status | Type |
|-----|--------|------|
| /paraphrase | **404 -- Does not exist** | N/A |
| /rewrite | **404 -- Does not exist** | N/A |
| /rephrase | **404 -- Does not exist** | N/A |
| /rewording-tool | **200 -- Active** | SEO landing page with embedded paraphraser tool |
| /sentence-rewriter | **200 -- Active** | SEO landing page with embedded tool, titled "Free AI Sentence Rewriter Tool" |

| /text-rewriter | **404 -- Does not exist** | N/A |
| /paraphrasing-tool | **200 -- Active** | Primary functional paraphrasing tool page (canonical URL) |

### Analysis
- **These are NOT separate tools.** The active SEO landing pages (/rewording-tool, /sentence-rewriter, /paragraph-rewriter) are marketing entry points that embed the same core paraphraser tool with different SEO-optimized copy.
- The canonical/primary URL for the paraphrasing tool is: **https://quillbot.com/paraphrasing-tool**
- Several of the suggested URLs (/paraphrase, /rewrite, /rephrase, /essay-rewriter, /article-rewriter, /text-rewriter) return **404 errors** and do not exist.
- The active SEO pages use the same React-based microfrontend architecture as the main tool
- They feature different headings and marketing copy targeting specific search queries (e.g., "sentence rewriter," "rewording tool," "paragraph rewriter")
- All pages include extensive footer navigation linking to the broader QuillBot ecosystem

## Key Observations & Summary

1. **Courses are OER aggregation, not original content.** QuillBot's courses are open educational resources from community colleges, hosted on Pressbooks. They are not courses created by QuillBot -- they are curated/republished content. This is a content marketing / SEO play.

2. **The /guides/ section is minimal.** Only 2 guide pages exist under /guides/. The real educational content lives on the blog (quillbot.com/blog/).

3. **Localization is partial.** While 6 UI languages exist, the depth varies significantly. German and French have the most localized content (blogs, tool pages, FAQ). Dutch and Portuguese have the least. Core tools like Flow, Summarizer, Citation Generator, and Plagiarism Checker remain English-only.

4. **SEO landing pages are thin wrappers.** The active ones (/rewording-tool, /sentence-rewriter, /paragraph-rewriter, /paraphrasing-tool) all embed the same paraphraser tool with different SEO copy. Several suggested URLs (/paraphrase, /rewrite, /rephrase, /essay-rewriter, /article-rewriter, /text-rewriter) return 404.

5. **QuillBot has expanded far beyond paraphrasing.** The tool suite now includes 25+ tools spanning writing, AI detection, image editing, PDF management, career tools, and more. It has evolved from a single-purpose paraphraser into a comprehensive writing and productivity platform.

6. **The affiliate program is competitively structured** with tiered commissions (10-20%) based on subscription length, managed through PartnerStack.

7. **Data privacy controls are notable.** Users can opt out of both text storage and model training, which is a competitive differentiator in the AI writing tool space.

8. **Onboarding is data-driven.** QuillBot uses Amplitude Analytics company-wide and has optimized signup flows to achieve 30% improvement, with retention-focused onboarding centered on the synonym drop-down feature.
